    "and an \"INDENT\" token is inserted into the token stream which is passed to the parser. There can never be more\n",

    "\"DEDENT\" token is generated. Obviously, there can be multiple \"DEDENT\" tokens in a row.\n",
    "The lexical analyzer skips empty lines (those containing only whitespace and possibly comments), and will never\n",
