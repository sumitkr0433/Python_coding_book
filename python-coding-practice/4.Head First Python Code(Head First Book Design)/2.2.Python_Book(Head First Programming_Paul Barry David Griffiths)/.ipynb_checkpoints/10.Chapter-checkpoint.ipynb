    "A:\n",
    "No, it wasn’t a tyop, eh, typo. The\n",

    "the word “from” makes a lot of sense when\n",
    "taking about a scale, the authors of tkinter\n",
    "decided to tack on the underscore so that\n",
    "the meaning of the variable would be clear,\n",

    "Q:\n",
    "A:\n",
    "Are there other reserved words?\n",
    "Yes, a few. And every programming\n",
    "language has its own list. In Python, words\n",

    "installed with Python on your computer and\n",
    "available on the web at the main Python\n",

    "Q:\n",
    "How do I know which graphical\n",

    "A:\n",
    "This is really a matter of experience.\n",
    "However, a lot of platforms go to great\n",

    "the elements should be used and for what\n",

    "less so. But there are still standards that\n",
    "you should try as much as possible to\n",
    "adhere to. One of the reasons for using\n",
    "a GUI is that your users will expect your\n",
