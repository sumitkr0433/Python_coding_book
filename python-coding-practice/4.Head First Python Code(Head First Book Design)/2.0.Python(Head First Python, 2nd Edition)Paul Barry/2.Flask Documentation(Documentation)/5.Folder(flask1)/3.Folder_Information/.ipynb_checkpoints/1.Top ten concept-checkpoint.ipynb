    "fact that the Python core developers (the people who guide the development of Python)\n",
    "decided that Python 3 was the future, and that Python 2 should quietly go away. There\n",
    "were solid technical reasons for this approach, but no one really expected things to take\n",
    "so long. After all, Python 3—the future of the language—first appeared in late 2008.\n",

    "3. More on Object Orientation\n",
    "If you’ve read through this entire book, by now you’ll (hopefully) appreciate what’s\n",
    "meant by this phrase: “In Python, everything’s an object.”\n",
    "Python’s use of objects is great. It generally means that things work the way you\n",

    "everything has to belong to a class, especially when it comes to your code.\n",
    "In this book, we didn’t learn how to create our own class until we needed one in\n",
    "order to create a custom context manager. Even then, we only learned as much as\n",
    "was needed, and nothing more. If you’ve come to Python from a programming\n",
    "language that insists all your code resides in a class (with Java being the classic\n",
    "example), the way we’ve gone about things in this book may be disconcerting.\n",
    "Don’t let this worry you, as Python is much less strict than Java (for instance) when\n",
    "it comes to how you go about writing your programs.\n",
    "If you decide to create a bunch of functions to do the work you need to do, then\n",
    "have at it. If your brain thinks in a more functional way, Python can help here\n",
    "too with the comprehension syntax, tipping its hat to the world of functional\n",
    "programming. And if you can’t get away from the fact that your code needs to\n",
    "reside in a class, Python has full-featured object-oriented-programming syntax\n",
    "built right in.\n",
    "If you do end up spending a lot of time creating classes, check out the following:\n",
    "• @staticmethod: A decorator that lets you create a static function\n",
    "within a class (which does not receive self as its first argument).\n",
    "• @classmethod: A decorator that lets you create a class method that\n",
    "expects a class as its first object (usually referred to as cls), not self.\n",
    "• @property: A decorator that allows you to redesignate and use a\n",
    "method as if it were an attribute.\n",
    "• __slots__: A class directive that (when used) can greatly improve\n",
    "the memory efficiency of the objects created from your class (at the\n",
    "expense of some flexibility).\n",
    "To learn more about any of these, consult the Python docs (https://docs.python.\n",
