    "Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The use of comprehensions and generator functions is often regarded as an advanced\n",
    "topic in the Python world. However, this is mainly due to the fact that these features\n",
    "are missing from other mainstream programming languages, which means that\n",
    "programmers moving to Python sometimes struggle with them (as they have no\n",
    "existing point of reference).\n",
    "That said, over at Head First Labs, the Python programming team loves comprehensions\n",
    "and generators, and believes that with repeated exposure, specifying the looping\n",
    "constructs that use them becomes second nature. They can’t imagine having to do\n",
    "without them.\n",
    "Even if you find the comprehension and generator syntax weird, our advice is to\n",
    "stick with them. Even if you dismiss the fact that they are more performant than the\n",
    "equivalent for loop, the fact that you can use comprehensions and generators in\n",
    "places where you cannot use a for loop is reason enough to take a serious look at\n",
    "these Python features. Over time, and as you become more familiar with their syntax,\n",
    "opportunities to exploit comprehensions and generators will present themselves as\n",
    "naturally as those that tell your programming brain to use a function here, a loop\n",
    "there, a class over here, and so on. Here’s a review of what you were introduced to in\n",
    "this chapter:\n",
    "  When it comes to working with data in files, Python has\n",
    "options. As well as the standard open BIF, you can\n",
    "use the facilities of the standard library’s csv module to\n",
    "work with CSV-formatted data.\n",
    "  Method chains allow you to perform processing on\n",
    "data in one line of code. The string.strip().\n",
    "split() chain is seen a lot in Python code.\n",
    "  Take care with how you order your method chains.\n",
    "Specifically, pay attention to the type of data returned\n",
    "from each method (and ensure type compatibility is\n",
    "maintained).\n",
    "  A for loop used to transform data from one format to\n",
    "another can be reworked as a comprehension.\n",
    "  Comprehensions can be written to process existing lists,\n",
    "dictionaries, and sets, with list comprehensions being\n",
    "the most popular variant “in the wild.” Seasoned Python\n",
    "programmers refer to these constructs as listcomps,\n",
    "dictcomps, and setcomps.\n",
    "  A listcomp is code surrounded by square brackets,\n",
