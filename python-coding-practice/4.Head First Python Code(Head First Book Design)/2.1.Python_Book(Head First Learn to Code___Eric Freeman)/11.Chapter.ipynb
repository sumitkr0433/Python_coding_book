    "How we’re going to build the simulator\n",
    "Now that we’ve got the interface designed on paper and we’ve also done a bit of paper prototype testing, we can\n",
    "feel pretty good about moving forward on the implementation. We do need some idea of how we’re going to\n",
    "tackle implementing all this, though.\n",
    "To do that we’re going to use a tried-and-true design that is used across the industry for building user interfaces,\n",
    "and it involves thinking about our code in three conceptual pieces: the underlying data model, the view, and the\n",
    "controller, otherwise known as MVC.\n",
    "Now, separating things into a discrete model, view, and controller typically requires that we use object-oriented\n",
    "techniques—something we’re not even going to talk about until the next chapter, but we are going to follow this\n",
    "design conceptually. In other words, we’re not going to go crazy following the MVC pattern, but we are going to\n",
    "take some inspiration from it, while keeping things as simple as we can.\n",
    "Here’s how we’re going to think about the design:\n",
    "The View\n",
    "The view code is\n",
    "concerned with what is\n",
    "displayed on the interface.\n",
    "It does not care about the\n",
    "specifics of what is being\n",
    "computed other than\n",
    "knowing it has to display\n",
    "data on a grid.\n",
    "The Controller\n",
    "The controller takes\n",
    "any user requests\n",
    "coming through the\n",
    "interface (like to start\n",
    "the game) and maps\n",
    "them to requests that\n",
    "need to be made of the\n",
    "model or the view.\n",
    "The Model\n",
    "The model code only cares\n",
    "about the data for the\n",
    "grid and cells, and how to\n",
    "compute new generations.\n",
    "It doesn’t care or know\n",
    "about the view.\n",
    "You’ll often hear this\n",
    "design referred to as the\n",
    "MVC design pattern, or as\n",
    "model-view-controller.\n",
    "An entire subfield of study\n",
    "called “software design\n",
    "patterns” concerns how\n",
    "these designs emerged over\n",
    "time and how they work.\n",
    "So we have three distinct pieces to code: a view that only worries about how to display things; a model\n",
    "that only cares about computing a grid of cells and doesn’t want to know anything about how it is being\n",
    "displayed; and a controller, which manages user interaction and relays commands to the view and model\n",
    "as necessary.\n",
    "So why all the trouble? Why do we need MVC? Well, history has taught developers that apps built with\n",
    "user interfaces can all too quickly become a pile of unmanageable spaghetti code (yes, that is a technical\n",
    "term; Google it). MVC allows us to avoid that by keeping each piece focused on one responsibility\n",
    "(among other reasons).\n",
    "At this point you don’t need to fully understand MVC, but at least now you’ve had some exposure to the\n",
    "idea, and as you’ll see, it’s going to give us a good way to approach building our simulator. So, with that,\n",
