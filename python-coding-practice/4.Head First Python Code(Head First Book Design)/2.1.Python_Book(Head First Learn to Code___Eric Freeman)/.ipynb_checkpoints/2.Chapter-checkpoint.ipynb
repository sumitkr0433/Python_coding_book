    "Fixing our code\n",
    "Well, it looks like our little bug was caused by an assumption we\n",
    "made about types: we assumed that if we supplied a number when\n",
    "prompted by the input function, then we’d have a number returned\n",

    "a string. No worries, though—this is exactly why we test as we go, to\n",
    "uncover bugs like this. And, as it turns out, Python has a handy way\n",
    "to convert a string to a numeric value.\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "1\n",
    "First, let’s create a string representation of a number.\n",
    "answer = '42'\n",
    "2\n",
    "Here the string ‘42’\n",
    "is assigned to the\n",
    "variable answer.\n",
    "Next, call the int function and pass it the string.\n",

    "Look,\n",
    "Ma, I’m an int!\n",
    "Here the string ‘42’ is\n",
    "converted to an integer and\n",
    "assigned to the variable answer.\n",
    "Q:\n",
    "What happens if my string\n",
    "doesn’t have a number in it and I call\n",
    "the int function? Like int('hi')?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "If you call the int function and\n",
    "pass it a string that does not contain a\n",
    "number, then you’ll get a runtime error that\n",
    "indicates your value is not a number.\n",
    "Q:\n",
    "Does the int function work only\n",
    "with integers values; for instance,\n",
    "could I use int('3.14')?\n",
    "A:\n",
    "The int function only works for\n",
    "integers (or rather, strings that represent\n",
    "integers), but if you need to convert a\n",
    "string that contains a float value, like\n",
    "'3.14', you can use the float function, like\n",
    "float('3.14'), to convert it to a floating-\n",
    "point value.\n",
    "So we know that the bug is caused by our assumption that dog_age is a number,\n",
