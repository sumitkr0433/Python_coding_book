Besides some basic rules, such as indentation, maximum line length, and other details concerning the code layout, PEP 8 also provides a section on naming conventions that most of the code bases follow.\n",

    "Why and when to follow PEP 8?\n",
    "If you are creating a new software package that is intended to be open sourced, you should always follow PEP 8 because it is a widely accepted standard and is used in most of the open source projects written in Python. If you want to foster any collaboration with other programmers, then you should definitely stick to PEP 8, even if you have different views on the best code style guidelines. Doing so has the benefit of making it a lot easier for other developers to jump straight into your project. Code will be easier to read for newcomers because it will be consistent in style with most of the other Python open source packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, starting with full PEP 8 compliance saves you time and trouble in the future. If you want to release your code to the public, you will eventually face suggestions from fellow programmers to switch to PEP 8. Arguments as to whether it is really necessary to do so for a particular project tend to be never-ending flame wars that are impossible to win. This is the sad truth, but you may be eventually forced to be consistent with it or risk losing valuable contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, restyling of the whole project's code base if it is in a mature state of development might require a tremendous amount of work. In some cases, such restyling might require changing almost every line of code. While most of the changes can be automated (indentation, newlines, and trailing whitespaces), such massive code overhaul usually introduces a lot of conflicts in every version control workflow that is based on branching. It is also very hard to review so many changes at once. These are the reasons why many open source projects have a rule that style-fixing changes should always be included in separate pull/merge requests or patches that do not affect any feature or bug."

    "Despite providing a comprehensive set of style guidelines, PEP 8 still leaves some freedom for the developers. Especially in terms of nested data literals and multiline function calls that require long lists of arguments. Some teams may decide that they require additional styling rules and the best option is to formalize them in some kind of document that is available for every team member.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in some situations, it may be impossible or economically infeasible to be strictly consistent with PEP 8 in some old projects that had no style guide defined. Such projects will still benefit from formalization of the actual coding conventions even if they do not reflect the official set of PEP 8 rules. Remember, what is more important than consistency with PEP 8 is consistency within the project. If rules are formalized and available as a reference for every programmer, then it is way easier to keep consistency within a project and organization.\n",

    "For constant global variables, an uppercase with an underscore is used. It informs the developer that the given variable represents a constant value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no real constants in Python like those in C++, where const can be used. You can change the value of any variable. That's why Python uses a naming convention to mark a variable as a constant.\n",
    "For example, the doctest module provides a list of option flags and directives (http://docs.python.org/lib/doctest-options.html) that are small sentences, clearly defining what each option is intended for, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from doctest import IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL \n",
    "from doctest import REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE \n",
    "These variable names seem rather long, but it is important to clearly describe them. Their usage is mostly located in the initialization code rather than in the body of the code itself, so this verbosity is not annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abbreviated names obfuscate the code most of the time. Don't be afraid of using complete words when an abbreviation seems unclear.\n",
    "Some constants' names are also driven by the underlying technology. For instance, the os module uses some constants that are defined on the C side, such as the EX_XXX series, that defines UNIX exit code numbers. Same name code can be found, as in the following example, in the system's sysexits.h C headers files:\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.exit(os.EX_SOFTWARE)\n",
    "Another good practice when using constants is to gather all of them at the top of a module that uses them. It is also common to combine them under new variables if they are flags or enumerations that allow for such operations, for example:\n",
    "\n",

But some people argue that it is rather an overkill to use another file format in a language such as Python, where a source file can be edited and changed as easily as a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For options that act like flags, a common practice is to combine them with Boolean operations, as the doctest and re modules do. The pattern taken from doctest is quite simple, as shown in the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIONS = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "def register_option(name):\n",

    "BLUE = register_option('BLUE')\n",
    "RED = register_option('RED')\n",

    "Another good solution for option-like constants would be to use the Enum class from the built-in enum module and simply rely on the set collection instead of the binary operators. Details of the enum module usage and syntax were explained in the Symbolic enumeration with enum module section of Chapter 3, Modern Syntax Elements - Below the Class Level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using binary bit-wise operations to combine options is common in Python. The inclusive OR (|) operator will let you combine several options in a single integer, and the AND (&) operator will let you check that the option is present in the integer (refer to the has_option function).\n",

In other words, if the variable is used only internally for the purpose of some other method that provides an actual public feature, it is better to make it private.\n",

    "Functions and methods should be in lowercase with underscores. This rule was not always true in the old standard library modules. Python 3 did a lot of reorganization of the standard library, so most of the functions and methods have a consistent letter case. Still, for some modules such as threading, you can access the old function names that used mixedCase (for example, currentThread). This was left to allow easier backward compatibility, but if you don't need to run your code in older versions of Python, then you should avoid using these old names.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of writing methods was common before the lowercase norm became the standard, and some frameworks, such as Zope and Twisted, are also still using mixedCase for methods. The community of developers working with them is still quite large. So the choice between mixedCase and lowercase with an underscore is definitely driven by the libraries you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Zope developer, it is not easy to stay consistent because building an application that mixes pure Python modules and modules that import Zope code is difficult. In Zope, some classes mix both conventions because the code base is still evolving and Zope developers try to adopt the common conventions accepted by so many.\n",

    "A decent practice in this kind of library environment is to use mixedCase only for elements that are exposed in the framework, and to keep the rest of the code in PEP 8 style.\n",

    "It is also worth noting that developers of the Twisted project took a completely different approach to this problem. The Twisted project, same as Zope, predates the PEP 8 document. It was started when there were no official guidelines for Python code style, so it had its own guidelines. Stylistic rules about the indentation, docstrings, line lengths, and so on could be easily adopted. On the other hand, updating all the code to match naming conventions from PEP 8 would result in completely broken backward compatibility. And doing that for such a large project as Twisted is infeasible. So Twisted adopted as much of PEP 8 as possible and left things such as mixedCase for variables, functions, and methods as part of its own coding standard. And this is completely compatible with the PEP 8 suggestion because it exactly says that consistency within a project is more important than consistency with PEP 8's style guide."

But it doesn't mean that leading underscores have no syntactical meaning at all. When a method has two leading underscores, it is renamed on the fly by the interpreter to prevent a name collision with a method from any subclass. This feature of Python is called name mangling.\n",

Everything started with the distutils package introduced in 1998, which was later enhanced by setuptools in 2003. These two projects started a long and knotted story of forks, alternative projects, and complete rewrites that tried to (once and for all) fix the Python packaging ecosystem. Unfortunately, most of these attempts never succeeded. The effect was quite the opposite. Each new project that aimed to supersede setuptools or distutils only added to the already huge confusion around packaging tools. Some of such forks were merged back to their ancestors (such as distribute which was a fork of setuptools) but some were left abandoned (such as distutils2).\n",

Treat that site as the best source of information about packaging and complementary reading for this chapter.

Both setuptools and distutils cannot automatically pick metadata information from the project sources, so you need to provide it yourself.

    "Automated inclusion of version string from package\n",
    "The PEP 440 Version Identification and Dependency Specification document specifies a standard for version and dependency specification. It is a long document that covers accepted version specification schemes and defines how version matching and comparison in Python packaging tools should work. If you are using or plan to use a complex project version numbering scheme, then you should definitely read this document carefully. If you are using a simple scheme that consists just of one, two, three, or more numbers separated by dots, then you don't have to dig into the details of PEP 440. If you don't know how to choose the proper versioning scheme, I greatly recommend following the semantic versioning scheme that was already briefly mentioned in Chapter 1, Current Status of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other problem related to code versioning is where to include that version specifier for a package or module. There is PEP 396 (Module Version Numbers) that deals exactly with this problem. PEP 396 is only an informational document and has a deferred status, so it is not a part of the official Python standards track. Anyway, it describes what seems to be a de facto standard now. According to PEP 396, if a package or module has a specific version defined, the version specifier should be included as a __version__ attribute of package root __init__.py INI file or distributed module file. Another de facto standard is to also include the VERSION attribute that contains the tuple of the version specifier parts. This helps users to write compatibility code because such version tuples can be easily compared if the versioning scheme is simple enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "So many packages available on PyPI follow both conventions. Their __init__.py files contain version attributes that look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# version as tuple for simple comparisons \n",
    "VERSION = (0, 1, 1) \n",
    "# string created from tuple to avoid inconsistency \n",
    "__version__ = \".\".join([str(x) for x in VERSION]) \n",
    "The other suggestion of PEP 396 is that the version argument provided in the setup() function of the setup.py script should be derived from __version__, or the other way around. The Python Packaging User Guide features multiple patterns for single-sourcing project versioning, and each of them has its own advantages and limitations. My personal favorite is rather long and is not included in the PyPA's guide, but has the advantage of limiting the complexity only to the setup.py script. This boilerplate assumes that the version specifier is provided by the VERSION attribute of the package's __init__ module and extracts this data for inclusion in the setup() call.

If you send a broken package to the repository, then in order to re-upload it, you need to increase the version number.\n",

This means that whenever you make a change to the sources of that package, you are required to reinstall it.

This is why setuptools provides an extra develop command that allows you to install packages in the development mode.

    "\n",
    "Namespace packages are especially useful if you have components of your application developed, packaged, and versioned independently but you still want to access them from the same namespace. This also helps to make clear to which organization or project every package belongs. For instance, for some imaginary Acme company, the common namespace could be acme. Therefore this organization could create the general acme namespace package that could serve as a container for other packages from this organization. For example, if someone from Acme wants to contribute to this namespace with, for example, an SQL-related library, they can create a new acme.sql package that registers itself in the acme namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know what's the difference between normal and namespace packages and what problem they solve. Normally (without namespace packages), you would create a package called acme with an sql subpackage/submodule with the following file structure:\n",

    "$ tree acme/\n",
    "acme/\n",

    "â””â”€â”€ setup.py\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3 directories, 4 files\n",
    "Such an approach makes independent development of acme.sql and acme.templating almost impossible. The setup.py script will also have to specify all dependencies for every subpackage. So it is impossible (or at least very hard) to have an installation of some of the acme components optional. Also, with enough subpackages it is practically impossible to avoid dependency conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "With namespace packages, you can store the source tree for each of these subpackages independently as follows:\n",

    "â””â”€â”€ setup.py\n",
    "\n",
    "2 directories, 2 files\n",
    "And you can also register them independently in PyPI or any package index you use. Users can choose which of the subpackages they want to install from the acme namespace as follows, but they never install the general acme package (it doesn't even have to exist):\n",

    "$ pip install acme.sql acme.templating\n",
