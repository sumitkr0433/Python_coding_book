    "Flask comes up with an inbuilt development server, which assists you in the development process and in the testing \n",
    "of programs.\n",
    "Error logging is made simple in Flask, with its interactive web-based debugger. When executing your code, if any \n",
    "bug has emerged in the way, an error stack trace will be shown on the web page, which makes it easy to deal with.\n",
    "This can be achieved by setting the flag of app.debug to True.\n",
    "With its lightweight nature, Flask is a perfect framework to build RESTful web services. The route decorator which \n",
    "helps to bind a function to a URL can take the HTTP methods as arguments that pave a way to build API's in an ideal\n",
    "manner. In addition, working with JSON data is simple with Flask.\n",
    "The template support for Flask is served by a flexible template engine called Jinja2. This makes the process of \n",
    "rendering the templates a smoother task.The Session object is another goodie which saves the user's session. \n",
    "It stores the requests of the user so that the application can remember the different requests from the user.\n",
