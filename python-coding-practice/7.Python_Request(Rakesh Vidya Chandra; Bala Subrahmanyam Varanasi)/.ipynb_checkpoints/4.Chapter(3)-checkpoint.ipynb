    "The main advantage of using this scheme is that it is supported by most of the web browsers and servers. Even though it is simple and straightforward, it does have some disadvantages. Though all the credentials are encoded and transferred in the requests, they are not encrypted which makes the process insecure. One way to overcome this problem is by using SSL support while initiating a secure session.\n",
