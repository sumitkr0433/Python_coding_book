    "In this contemporary world, our lives are woven with a lot of interactions and collaborations with social media. The information that is available on the web is very valuable and it is being used by abundant resources. For instance, the news that is trending in the world can be spotted easily from a Twitter hashtag and this can be achieved by interacting with the Twitter API.\n",

All this stuff can be accomplished easily with the help of Requests using the concerned APIs.

    "\n",
    "There are four different types of Access tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Access Token: This is the most commonly used type of access token which needs the authorization of users. This token can be used to access the user information and to post data on the user's timeline.\n",
    "App Access Token: This token comes into the picture when dealing at the Application level. This token doesn't help in getting access to the user's data, but it gives access to read the stream.\n",
    "Page Access Token: This token can used while accessing and managing a Facebook page.\n",
    "Client Token: This token can be embedded in an application to get access to the app-level API's.\n",
