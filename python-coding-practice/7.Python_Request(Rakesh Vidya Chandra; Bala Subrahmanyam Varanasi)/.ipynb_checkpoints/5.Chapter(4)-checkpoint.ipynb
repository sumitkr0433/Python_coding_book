In a nutshell, the preceding code tries to mock the URI and tests whether we are getting the same status code as expected.\n",

As in the first and third step, that is, enabling and disabling HTTPretty are same all the time, we can use a decorator so that those functions get wrapped up whenever we want them to come into the picture.
